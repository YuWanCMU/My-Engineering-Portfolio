        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This project develops an interactive Rubik&apos;s Cube
          application aimed at teaching users how solving algorithms
          work. The educational goal is to make abstract
          group-theoretic ideas more accessible by visualising cube
          states and move sequences.
        </p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
          The application renders a 3D Rubik&apos;s Cube with adjustable
          perspective and supports mouse or keyboard-driven rotations. A
          scrambling module generates random but reproducible sequences,
          while a solver module implements a layer-by-layer
          reverse-sequence algorithm. Users can step through the
          solution move by move, with the current sub-goal highlighted
          (for example solving the cross, corners, or final layer). The
          tool also records moves, enabling comparison between the
          user&apos;s attempt and the guided solution.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Informal user testing with students showed that the tool helps
          them understand and remember solving patterns more effectively
          than static diagrams alone. The interface allows users to
          freely experiment, reset, and replay the solution, and the
          underlying engine correctly solves any scrambled cube
          generated by the application.
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          The project illustrates how visualisation and interaction can
          turn an abstract combinatorial puzzle into an engaging learning
          experience. Similar ideas could be extended to other topics
          such as kinematics, control, or optimisation, where complex
          state transitions benefit from interactive exploration.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented the cube representation and move logic, designed
          the user interface and interaction flow, and created the
          educational overlays that explain each solving stage. I also
          led a small student team responsible for testing and refining
          the application behaviour.
