        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Many real engineering problems involve conflicting objectives,
          such as minimising weight while maximising strength. This
          project extends interval-based optimisation to the
          multi-objective case, targeting complete and rigorous
          approximation of the Pareto front. The social value lies in
          supporting better design trade-offs in high-dimensional
          problems where traditional evolutionary algorithms struggle.
        </p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
          A benchmark multi-objective test problem with disconnected and
          highly oscillatory Pareto fronts was reformulated using
          interval arithmetic. Each GPU thread evaluates a sub-region of
          the decision space and computes interval enclosures for all
          objectives. Dominance tests between interval vectors are used
          to discard regions that are guaranteed to be dominated, while
          non-dominated regions are recursively refined. The
          implementation uses shared and constant memory to reduce
          global memory traffic and employs Latin Hypercube Sampling to
          initialise promising regions.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The method produced an interval approximation of the Pareto
          front that fully covers all disconnected segments within
          proven bounds. In contrast, reference evolutionary algorithms
          such as NSGA-II and MOEA/D often miss parts of the front in
          the same test problem. The resulting plots show the surviving
          objective-space regions as yellow bands, illustrating both the
          completeness of coverage and the remaining uncertainty width.
        </p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          The project shows that interval methods can complement or
          replace stochastic multi-objective algorithms when
          completeness and rigour are more important than obtaining a
          single, visually smooth front. This is particularly relevant
          in safety-critical or regulatory-driven applications where
          decision makers require guarantees on the existence of all
          trade-off solutions.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          I formulated the multi-objective interval algorithm,
          implemented all GPU kernels and data structures, and conducted
          comparative experiments against standard evolutionary
          algorithms including NSGA-II and MOEA/D.
